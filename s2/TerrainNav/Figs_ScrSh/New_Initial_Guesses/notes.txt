SINGLE SCALE FACTOR 70 
Does it make sense?
Image #
0. YES
1. Somewhat: wrong y - scaling issue 
2. YES
3. Somewhat: wrong y - scaling issue 
4. YES
5. NO: wrong Y - Review - should be Neg Y (5,14) - FOLDER B5
6. NO: wrong Y - Review - should be Pos Y (-13,-9)
7. YES
8. NO: wrong Y - Review - should be Pos Y (14, -13)
9. YES


SINGLE SCALE FACTOR 80 (original)
0. YES
1. YES
2. YES
3. YES
4. YES
5. YES (could be more, but trend is correct)
6. YES
7. YES - A7
8. NO: REVIEW - should be Pos x, Pos Y (-16, -25)-wrong yardage - window size issue
9. YES


DUAL SCALE FACTOR 75, 80
0. YES
1. YES
2. YES
3. YES
4. YES
5. NO (X should be negative) - window size issue (16,-10)
6. NO (X should be positive) - window size issue (-22,25)
7. YES
8. YES (could be more, but trend is correct), window size 
9. NO (Y should be positive) - scale and window size issue (-15, -15)
